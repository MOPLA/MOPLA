Modeling the mechanicall behavior of the heterogeneous rock mass which is % composed of rheologically distinctive elements(RDEs). Here, the heterogeneous % rock mass is replaced by a homogeneous effective medium(HEM) and the % rehological properties of HEM at a point are represented by the overall % effective propertives of all surrounding RDEs.
